Highway to hell

Living easy
Loving free
Season ticket for a one way ride
Asking nothing
Leave me be
Taken everything in my stride
Don't need reason
Don't need rhyme
Ain't nothin' I would rather do
Going down
By the time
My friends are gonna be there too.

I'm on a highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell.

No stop signs
Speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel
Gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me 'round
Hey Satan
Paid my dues
Playin' in a rockin' band
Hey momma
Look at me
I'm on my way to the Promised Land.

I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell.

Don't stop me.

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to
Hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell.

And I'm goin' down, all the waa-ay-aay
Ðžn the highway to hell.
